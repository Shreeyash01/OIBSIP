                        Shivaji Bhonsale I, also referred to as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, was an Indian ruler and a
                        member of the Bhonsle Maratha clan. Shivaji carved out his own independent kingdom from the
                        declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur which formed the genesis of the Maratha Empire.

                        Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the founder of the Maratha Empire in western India. He is
                        considered to be one of the greatest warriors of his time and even today, stories of his
                        exploits are narrated as a part of the folklore. With his valor and great administrative skills,
                        Shivaji Maharaj carved out an enclave from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of Bijapur. It
                        eventually became the genesis of the Maratha Empire. After establishing his rule, Shivaji
                        Maharaj implemented a competent and progressive administration with the help of a disciplined
                        military and well-established administrative set-up. Shivaji Maharaj is well-known for his
                        innovative military tactics that centered around non-conventional methods leveraging strategic
                        factors like geography, speed, and surprise to defeat his more powerful enemies.
